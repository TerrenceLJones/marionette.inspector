## Understand your App, without understanding all the code

The Marionette Inspector offers powerful tools for exploring applications.

+ **Visualize** the view hierarchy with the UI tree
+ **Visualize** application activity with a full history of actions
+ **Inspect** view ui, events, listeners, properties
+ **Inspect** model attributes, listeners, properties
+ **Explore** Radio channel events, requests, commands
+ **Explore** application with an inspector magnifying glass
+ **Jump** between the inspector elements and source panel with intelligent links

### Getting Started


#### Download it
The inspector should work out of the box with most setups. You can download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marionette-inspector/fbgfjlockdhidoaempmjcddibjklhpka?hl=en).

#### Caveats
If you're either using `Browserify` or `Webpack` or not exposing `Backbone` & `Marionette` as globals, you'll need to add one block to your setup.

```js
if (window.__agent) {
  window.__agent.start(Backbone, Marionette);
}
```

> Note this line should be placed after all underscore, backbone, and marionette REQUIRES, but before Application or View classes are defined.

#### Frequently Asked Questions
If you have any additional questions, check out our [FAQ](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/docs/faq.md).

### Play with it locally
Follows these these steps in the [Install Guide](docs/developing_locally.md) and you should be up and running in no time.

Read the [agent](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/docs/agent.md) overview to understand how the inspector gathers all the information.


### Open Source (a.k.a. you)

The inspector is built with 100% open source love. That means, we absolutely want your help and your passion. If you want to get involved, stop by and say hello [here](https://gitter.im/marionettejs/marionette.inspector). We've got tons of [help wanted](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tickets and would be be happy to setup a 30 minute [screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) pairing session to help you get started. Many of our contributions, even some of the best ones like the Activity pane, came from first time contributors.
